abstract = {In order to model older people's behaviour in the home we must first understand it. In this paper we examine data from eight purpose-built aware homes over a six-month period, looking at presence in rooms to try to determine patterns amongst the older residents. We look for homes that have similar movement patterns using cluster analysis. We also examine how movement over days clusters within individual homes. Our analysis begins to show the possibilities of distinguishing between residents in their homes based on patterns of movement.},

abstract = {Detecting wellness in older adults with just ambient sensors is a challenging and difficult task, one that can only be address with large volumes of detailed annotated data and a diverse participant base. Presented here are early results comparing movement data to baseline depression and mobility data from a purpose built 16 unit ambient assisted living development in Ireland. With the goal of ultimately detecting health changes in an older population with ambient sensors, results here show that whereas there is some correlations between health measures and sensor data as well as some observable patterns, but more work needs to be done.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a dramatic proliferation of research on information retrieval based on highly subjective concepts such as emotion, preference and aesthetic. Such retrieval methods are fascinating but challenging since it is difficult to built a general retrieval model that performs equally well to everyone. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, bag-of-users model and residual modeling, to accommodate the individual differences for emotion-based music retrieval. The proposed methods are intuitive and generally applicable to other information retrieval tasks that involve subjective perception. Evaluation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {The emotions expressed through music have often been investigated by asking listeners to fill questionnaires at the end of a given musical performance or an excerpt; only few studies have been dedicated to the understanding of the dynamics of emotions expressed by music in laboratory or in social contexts. Based on a specific model of emotions related to music, the Geneva Emotion Music Scale (GEMS), we tested to what extent such dynamic judgments are reliable and might be a promising avenue to better understand how listeners are able to attribute different kinds of emotions expressed through music and how the social contexts might influence such judgments. The results indicate a high reliability between listeners for different musical excerpts and for different contexts of listening including concerts, i.e. a social context, and laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {Entrainment, broadly defined, is a phenomenon in which two or more independent rhythmic processes synchronize with each other. To illuminate the significance of entrainment for various directions of music research and promote a nuanced understanding of the concept among ethnomusicologists, this publication opens with an exposition of entrainment research in various disciplines, from physics to linguistics and psychology, while systematically introducing basic concepts that are directly relevant to musical entrainment. Topics covered include consideration of self-synchrony and interpersonal synchrony in musical performance, humans' innate propensities to entrain, the influence of cultural and personal factors on entrainment, the numerous functions of musical entrainment in individual health, socialization, and cultural identification, and a presentation of methodologies and analytical techniques. Finally, some case studies illustrating one methodological strand, that of chronometric analysis, exemplify how the application of the entrainment concept might lead to an understanding of music making and music perception as an integrated, embodied and interactive process.},

The terminal has been installed in museums and galleries in Europe and the USA, helping create the largest database of physiology and self-report data while listening to music.},
