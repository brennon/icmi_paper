abstract = {In order to model older people's behaviour in the home we must first understand it. In this paper we examine data from eight purpose-built aware homes over a six-month period, looking at presence in rooms to try to determine patterns amongst the older residents. We look for homes that have similar movement patterns using cluster analysis. We also examine how movement over days clusters within individual homes. Our analysis begins to show the possibilities of distinguishing between residents in their homes based on patterns of movement.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new interface for mobile music cre- ation, the MobileMuse, that introduces the capability of us- ing physiological indicators of emotion as a new mode of interaction. Combining both kinematic and physiological measurement in a mobile environment creates the possibil- ity of integral music control---the use of both gesture and emotion to control sound creation---where it has never been possible before. This paper will review the concept of inte- gral music control and describe the motivation for creating the MobileMuse, its design and future possibilities.},

abstract = {Detecting wellness in older adults with just ambient sensors is a challenging and difficult task, one that can only be address with large volumes of detailed annotated data and a diverse participant base. Presented here are early results comparing movement data to baseline depression and mobility data from a purpose built 16 unit ambient assisted living development in Ireland. With the goal of ultimately detecting health changes in an older population with ambient sensors, results here show that whereas there is some correlations between health measures and sensor data as well as some observable patterns, but more work needs to be done.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a dramatic proliferation of research on information retrieval based on highly subjective concepts such as emotion, preference and aesthetic. Such retrieval methods are fascinating but challenging since it is difficult to built a general retrieval model that performs equally well to everyone. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, bag-of-users model and residual modeling, to accommodate the individual differences for emotion-based music retrieval. The proposed methods are intuitive and generally applicable to other information retrieval tasks that involve subjective perception. Evaluation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {The emotions expressed through music have often been investigated by asking listeners to fill questionnaires at the end of a given musical performance or an excerpt; only few studies have been dedicated to the understanding of the dynamics of emotions expressed by music in laboratory or in social contexts. Based on a specific model of emotions related to music, the Geneva Emotion Music Scale (GEMS), we tested to what extent such dynamic judgments are reliable and might be a promising avenue to better understand how listeners are able to attribute different kinds of emotions expressed through music and how the social contexts might influence such judgments. The results indicate a high reliability between listeners for different musical excerpts and for different contexts of listening including concerts, i.e. a social context, and laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {The effects of age and gender on heart rate variability as measured by spectral and time domain analysis of 24 h ECG recordings were evaluated in 101 healthy subjects, 49 men and 52 women (20-69 years of age). In the frequency domain, total power, very low-frequency power, low-frequency power and high-frequency power were negatively correlated to age (P \textless 0.001 for all variables). Total power decreased by 30% between 20-29 and 60-69 years of age. In the time domain, SDNN-index, the mean of the standard deviations of all normal R-R intervals for all 5 min segments of a 24 h ECG recording, was negatively correlated to age (P \textless 0.001). Total power, very low-frequency power, low-frequency power and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio were lower in women (P \textless 0.05, P \textless 0.05, P \textless 0.01 and P \textless 0.01), although the absolute differences were much smaller than for age. There was a pronounced circadian variation; at night total power increased in all age groups (P \textless 0.01). The results show that age, and to a lesser degree gender, are important determinants of heart rate variability in healthy subjects. Heart rate variability is a valuable tool for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease, but the physiological effects of ageing, with diminishing heart rate variability in older age groups, must also be taken into account.},

abstract = {Entrainment, broadly defined, is a phenomenon in which two or more independent rhythmic processes synchronize with each other. To illuminate the significance of entrainment for various directions of music research and promote a nuanced understanding of the concept among ethnomusicologists, this publication opens with an exposition of entrainment research in various disciplines, from physics to linguistics and psychology, while systematically introducing basic concepts that are directly relevant to musical entrainment. Topics covered include consideration of self-synchrony and interpersonal synchrony in musical performance, humans' innate propensities to entrain, the influence of cultural and personal factors on entrainment, the numerous functions of musical entrainment in individual health, socialization, and cultural identification, and a presentation of methodologies and analytical techniques. Finally, some case studies illustrating one methodological strand, that of chronometric analysis, exemplify how the application of the entrainment concept might lead to an understanding of music making and music perception as an integrated, embodied and interactive process.},

abstract = {Musical and performance experiences are often described as evoking powerful emotions, both in the listener/observer and layer/performer. There is a significant body of literature describing these experiences along with related work examining physiological changes in the body during music listening and the physiological correlates of emotional state. However there are still open questions as to how and why, emotional responses may be triggered by a performance, how audiences may be influenced by a performers mental or emotional state and what effect the presence of an audience has on performers. We present a pilot study and some initial findings of our investigations into these questions, utilising a custom software and hardware system we have developed. Although this research is still at a pilot stage, our initial experiments point towards significant correlation between the physiological states of performers and audiences and we here present the system, the experiments and our preliminary data.},

abstract = {In order to further understand our emotional reaction to music, a museum-based installation was designed to collect physiological and self-report data from people listening to music. This demo will describe the technical implementation of this installation as a tool for collecting large samples of data in public spaces. The Emotion in Motion terminal is built upon a standard desktop computer running Max/MSP and using sensors that measure physiological indicators of emotion that are connected to an Arduino. The terminal has been installed in museums and galleries in Europe and the USA, helping create the largest database of physiology and self-report data while listening to music.},
